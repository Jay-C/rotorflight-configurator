## Snapshot Release

This version is a development snapshot, intended to be used only for beta-testing.
It is not fully working nor stable, and should not be used by end-users.

The Configurator is currently under development, so please expect
many things to be broken, and changing rapidly.

For more information, please join the Rotorflight Discord chat.
